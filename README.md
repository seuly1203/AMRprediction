# Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques for predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The goal is to better understand the relationship between genomic or proteomic features and antimicrobial resistance, while iterating on methods and improving through lessons learned.

## Dataset Sources
1. Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)
   - Files used: `aro_index.tsv`, `protein_fasta_protein_homolog_model.fasta`
2. Universal Protein Resource (UniProt)
   - Dataset downloaded through keyword searches.
   - Removed entries suspected to be associated with resistance for cleaner data analysis.
